# Comprehensive Testing Strategy

This document outlines the strategy for comprehensive testing of the Microbial Analysis SaaS application, covering integration testing, end-to-end (E2E) testing, and performance testing. This builds upon the existing unit tests for individual components.

## 1. Overview and Goals

The primary goals of this comprehensive testing strategy are:
- Ensure all components of the application work together correctly.
- Verify that key user workflows are functional and meet requirements.
- Identify performance bottlenecks and ensure the application can handle expected load.
- Increase confidence in the application's reliability and robustness before deployment.

## 2. Testing Layers

### 2.1. Unit Tests (Already Implemented for Core Logic)
- **Focus:** Individual functions, methods, and Pydantic models.
- **Tools:** `pytest`.
- **Scope:** Continue ensuring all new backend logic (AI model placeholders, API endpoint logic, utility functions) is covered by unit tests.

### 2.2. Integration Tests

- **Focus:** Interactions between different components of the application.
- **Scope & Examples:**
    - **API to AI Model Interaction:**
        - Verify that API endpoints correctly call the respective AI model (placeholder) functions and handle their responses/exceptions.
        - Test with valid and invalid inputs to the API endpoints.
    - **API to Database Interaction (Once DB is implemented in later phases):**
        - Test CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) through API endpoints.
        - Verify data integrity, relationships between tables, and constraints.
        - Example: Test user registration, image metadata creation, storing analysis results, and retrieving them.
    - **API to Asynchronous Task Queue (Once Celery is implemented):**
        - Test that API endpoints correctly enqueue tasks.
        - Test polling for task status and retrieving results.
- **Tools:**
    - `pytest` with `TestClient` (for API level testing).
    - Fixtures to manage test data and component setup (e.g., test database, mock AI models if needed beyond placeholders).
    - For database interactions: A separate test database that is reset between test runs. SQLAlchemy's session management can be leveraged here.

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **Focus:** Simulating real user workflows through the entire application stack, from the frontend (UI) to the backend services and database (once implemented).
- **Scope & Key User Workflows to Test:**
    - User registration and login.
    - Uploading an image (simulated for now, actual upload when image storage is implemented).
    - Triggering each type of analysis (Colony Counting, Microbial Identification, Growth Monitoring, Antibiotic Resistance Prediction) via the UI.
    - Verifying that results are displayed correctly on the frontend.
    - Verifying that analysis parameters (if configurable in UI) are correctly passed to the backend.
    - Testing report generation and download (once implemented).
    - Testing data comparison features (once implemented).
- **Tools:**
    - **Frontend E2E Testing Frameworks:**
        - `Playwright` (Microsoft): Modern, supports multiple browsers, good for Python integration.
        - `Selenium`: Long-standing, wide support, can be more verbose.
        - `Cypress`: JavaScript-based, popular for frontend developers, might require a separate testing setup.
    - We will lean towards **Playwright** due to its Python support and modern feature set.
- **Considerations:**
    - E2E tests are typically slower and more brittle than unit or integration tests. Focus on critical workflows.
    - Requires a running instance of the full application (frontend and backend).
    - Test data management is crucial for E2E tests.

### 2.4. Performance Tests (Conceptual for now, more critical before production deployment)

- **Focus:** Evaluating the application's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various load conditions.
- **Scope & Metrics:**
    - **API Response Times:** Measure latency for key API endpoints.
    - **Throughput:** Number of requests per second the system can handle.
    - **Resource Utilization:** Monitor CPU, memory, network, and I/O usage on servers (API, database, workers) under load.
    - **Error Rates:** Track error rates under increasing load.
    - **Scalability of AI Tasks:** (Once Celery implemented) Test how well the system scales when many AI analysis tasks are queued and processed.
- **Tools:**
    - `Locust`: Python-based, allows writing load tests in Python.
    - `k6`: Modern, scriptable load testing tool with JavaScript.
    - `Apache JMeter`: Java-based, feature-rich, GUI-based.
- **Types of Performance Tests:**
    - **Load Testing:** Simulate expected user load.
    - **Stress Testing:** Push the system beyond normal operating conditions to find its breaking point.
    - **Soak Testing (Endurance Testing):** Run the system under sustained load for an extended period to detect issues like memory leaks.
- **Considerations:**
    - Performance testing should ideally be done in an environment that closely mirrors production.
    - Requires careful planning of test scenarios and load profiles.

## 3. Testing Environment and CI/CD

- **Test Data:** Develop a strategy for generating or obtaining realistic and varied test data for all testing layers. For images, this might include sample images with known characteristics.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    - Integrate unit and integration tests into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI).
    - Code should not be merged or deployed if tests fail.
    - E2E tests might run on a less frequent schedule (e.g., nightly) due to their longer execution time, or against a staging environment.
- **Staging Environment:** A dedicated staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible will be crucial for reliable E2E and performance testing.

This testing strategy will evolve as the application grows in complexity. Regular review and adaptation of the strategy are important.
