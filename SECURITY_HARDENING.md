# Security Hardening Design Document

This document outlines key security considerations and hardening strategies for the Microbial Analysis SaaS application. It focuses on mitigating common web vulnerabilities (inspired by OWASP Top 10), addressing data privacy, and utilizing security headers.

## 1. Mitigating OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities (Selection)

This is not exhaustive but highlights key areas relevant to our application.

*   **A01:2021 - Broken Access Control:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Ensure all API endpoints that handle sensitive data or perform actions are protected and require proper authentication and authorization (as outlined conceptually in `DATABASE_DESIGN.MD` - OAuth2).
        *   Implement checks to ensure a user can only access/modify their own data (e.g., their images, their analysis results).
        *   Carefully design admin roles and permissions if an admin interface is built.
        *   Avoid exposing internal IDs directly in URLs if they can be easily enumerated, or ensure proper ownership checks are in place.

*   **A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **HTTPS Everywhere:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication between client, API, and any external services. Use tools like Let's Encrypt for SSL/TLS certificates.
        *   **Password Hashing:** Store user passwords hashed using strong, salted algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2 via `passlib` as mentioned in `DATABASE_DESIGN.MD`).
        *   **Data Encryption at Rest:** Sensitive data in the database (e.g., user PII, potentially sensitive aspects of analysis results) should be encrypted at rest (many managed database services offer this by default).
        *   **Encryption in Transit for Internal Services:** If microservices are used, ensure communication between them is also encrypted.

*   **A03:2021 - Injection:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **SQL Injection:** If using an ORM like SQLAlchemy (planned for actual DB implementation), use it correctly to avoid raw SQL queries with user input. If raw SQL is unavoidable, use parameterized queries/prepared statements.
        *   **NoSQL Injection:** If a NoSQL database is used, understand its specific injection risks and use appropriate SDKs and validation.
        *   **OS Command Injection:** Avoid calling OS commands with user-supplied input. If essential, sanitize input rigorously and use built-in functions that handle arguments safely.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected/Stored:**
            *   FastAPI's default Jinja2 templating (if used for any server-side HTML rendering, though our current frontend is static HTML/JS) auto-escapes by default.
            *   For the current static JS frontend, ensure any data received from the API and rendered into the DOM is properly escaped/sanitized if it's not just text content (e.g., using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` where possible, or DOMPurify if HTML rendering from API data is needed).
            *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers (see section 3).

*   **A04:2021 - Insecure Design:** (Broad category)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Follow secure development lifecycle practices.
        *   Regularly review and update conceptual design documents (`DATABASE_DESIGN.MD`, etc.) with security in mind.
        *   Threat model critical application flows.

*   **A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Remove or disable unnecessary features, services, and debug modes in production.
        *   Ensure cloud storage (S3, GCS) bucket policies are restrictive and do not allow public anonymous access unless explicitly intended and secured.
        *   Keep all software (OS, Python, libraries, web server) up to date with security patches.
        *   Use environment variables for sensitive configurations (API keys, database credentials), not hardcoded values.

*   **A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Implement strong password policies (length, complexity - can be enforced client-side and server-side).
        *   Secure token generation, storage, and transmission (HTTPS, HttpOnly cookies if applicable for web).
        *   Consider rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   Implement secure account recovery mechanisms (if added).

*   **A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures:**
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Verify integrity of dependencies (e.g., using hash checking with `requirements.txt`).
        *   Protect CI/CD pipelines to prevent unauthorized code injection.
        *   Ensure data validation on input (Pydantic models help here) and output.

## 2. Data Privacy Considerations

*   **Minimize Data Collection:** Only collect user data that is strictly necessary for the application's functionality.
*   **Transparency:** Clearly inform users how their data (including uploaded images and analysis results) is collected, stored, used, and shared (e.g., via a Privacy Policy).
*   **User Control:** Provide users with mechanisms to access, review, and potentially delete their data, subject to legal/research constraints.
*   **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** For research purposes or aggregated statistics, consider anonymizing or pseudonymizing data if personal identifiers are not required.
*   **Compliance:** Be aware of relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if dealing with patient health information, CCPA) and design the system to comply. Secure data processing agreements if using third-party services.
*   **Data Retention Policies:** Define how long data will be stored and implement mechanisms for secure deletion.

## 3. Security Headers

Implement appropriate HTTP security headers to protect against common attacks:

*   **`Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`:**
    *   Define allowed sources for scripts, styles, images, etc., to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks.
    *   Example: `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; object-src 'none';` (This is a starting point and needs to be tailored).
*   **`Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`:**
    *   Ensures browsers only connect to the server via HTTPS.
    *   Example: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
*   **`X-Content-Type-Options`:**
    *   Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content type.
    *   Example: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
*   **`X-Frame-Options`:**
    *   Protects against clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the site can be embedded in an `<iframe>`.
    *   Example: `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`
*   **`Referrer-Policy`:**
    *   Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests.
    *   Example: `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` or `no-referrer`
*   **`Permissions-Policy` (formerly `Feature-Policy`):**
    *   Allows control over which browser features can be used by the site (e.g., camera, microphone, geolocation).
    *   Example: `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` (Disable if not needed)

These headers can be added via middleware in FastAPI.

**Note:** This document provides a conceptual overview. A thorough security audit and continuous monitoring are crucial for a production application.
