# Advanced Frontend Features - Conceptual Design

This document outlines conceptual designs for advanced frontend features for the Microbial Analysis SaaS application. These features aim to enhance user experience, provide deeper insights, and improve workflow efficiency.

## 1. Analysis Parameter Configuration

**Goal:** Allow users to fine-tune analysis parameters for more specific and accurate results.

**UI/UX Concepts:**

*   **Contextual Forms:** When a user selects an analysis type (e.g., Colony Counting, Microbial ID), a dedicated section or modal appears with relevant parameters.
*   **Default Values:** Provide sensible default parameters that work well for common use cases. Clearly indicate default values.
*   **Tooltips/Info Icons:** Next to each parameter, include a small icon or tooltip explaining what the parameter does and its typical range or options.
*   **Dynamic Input Fields:** Some parameters might dynamically change based on others (e.g., selecting a specific staining method might reveal relevant sub-parameters).
*   **Parameter Presets:** Allow users to save and load sets of parameters as "presets" for recurring experiments.

**Example Parameters (Illustrative):**

*   **Colony Counting:**
    *   `min_colony_size_pixels`: Minimum size for a detected object to be considered a colony.
    *   `max_colony_size_pixels`: Maximum size.
    *   `detection_threshold`: Sensitivity of the detection algorithm (0.0 - 1.0).
    *   `image_preprocessing_options`: (Checkbox/Dropdown) e.g., Grayscale conversion, background subtraction.
*   **Microbial Identification (if model supports it):**
    *   `identification_database`: (Dropdown) Select which microbial database to reference.
    *   `confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence score for an ID to be reported.
*   **Growth Monitoring:**
    *   `time_interval_hours`: Expected time between images in a series (for validation).
    *   `growth_metric`: (Dropdown) e.g., Change in count, change in total area.

## 2. Advanced Visualizations

**Goal:** Provide richer, interactive visualizations beyond simple data tables or static images.

**UI/UX Concepts & Potential Libraries:**

*   **Interactive Annotated Images:**
    *   Allow users to click on detected colonies/cells on an image to see detailed stats (size, shape, ID confidence).
    *   Overlay controls to toggle bounding boxes, segmentation masks, labels.
    *   **Libraries:** OpenSeaDragon (for zoom/pan), Konva.js, Fabric.js (for canvas interactions).
*   **Growth Curves/Time Series Plots:**
    *   Interactive line charts showing microbial growth over time (count vs. time, area vs. time).
    *   Allow comparison of multiple series on the same chart.
    *   Zoom, pan, hover-to-see-data-points.
    *   **Libraries:** Chart.js, Plotly.js, D3.js (for more custom needs).
*   **Distribution Histograms/Bar Charts:**
    *   Visualize distribution of colony sizes, identified species counts, etc.
    *   **Libraries:** Chart.js, Plotly.js.
*   **Heatmaps for Antibiotic Resistance:**
    *   Display resistance profiles as a heatmap (Antibiotics vs. Samples/Strains), with colors indicating Susceptible/Intermediate/Resistant.
    *   **Libraries:** Plotly.js, D3.js.
*   **Data Tables with Sorting/Filtering:**
    *   Enhance basic HTML tables with features for sorting by column, filtering by keywords.
    *   **Libraries:** DataTables.net, AG Grid (for very complex needs).

## 3. Dataset/Result Comparison Interface

**Goal:** Enable users to easily compare results from different images, samples, or analysis runs.

**UI/UX Concepts:**

*   **Selection Mechanism:**
    *   Allow users to select two or more analysis results from their history or a list.
    *   Could be a checklist, a drag-and-drop interface, or a multi-select dropdown.
*   **Side-by-Side View:**
    *   Display key information and visualizations from selected datasets next to each other.
    *   For images: Show images with annotations side-by-side.
    *   For tabular data: Show combined tables or highlight differences.
    *   For charts: Overlay line charts or group bar charts for direct comparison.
*   **Difference Highlighting:**
    *   Automatically highlight statistically significant differences or user-defined thresholds.
*   **Summary Comparison Table:**
    *   Generate a table that summarizes key metrics and their differences across the selected datasets.

## 4. Downloadable Reports

**Goal:** Allow users to export analysis results, visualizations, and interpretations for their records, presentations, or publications.

**Structure & Format Options:**

*   **CSV/TSV:**
    *   For raw quantitative data (colony counts, measurements, identified species lists, resistance profiles).
    *   Each row could represent a sample or a detected object.
*   **PDF:**
    *   A more comprehensive, formatted report.
    *   **Content Ideas:**
        *   Report title, date, user information.
        *   Input parameters used for the analysis.
        *   Summary of findings.
        *   Key visualizations (e.g., annotated images, charts) embedded.
        *   Detailed data tables.
        *   (Optional) AI model version and confidence scores.
        *   (Optional) Section for user notes.
    *   **Generation:**
        *   Could be generated client-side using libraries like `jsPDF` or `pdfmake`.
        *   For more complex reports or server-side generation: `ReportLab` (Python), `WeasyPrint` (Python).

**UI/UX for Report Generation:**

*   **"Download Report" Button:** Clearly visible after an analysis is complete or when viewing results.
*   **Format Selection:** Allow users to choose the desired format (PDF, CSV).
*   **Customization Options (Optional):**
    *   Select which sections to include in the PDF.
    *   Choose which data fields to include in CSV.
    *   Add a custom title or notes to the report.

## 5. Displaying AI Confidence Scores

**Goal:** Provide users with an indication of the AI's certainty in its predictions or analyses, promoting transparency and aiding in result interpretation.

**UI/UX Concepts:**

*   **Numeric Display:** Show the confidence score as a percentage (e.g., "Confidence: 95%") or a decimal (e.g., "Score: 0.95") directly alongside the relevant result (e.g., next to the identified microbe name, or below a colony count if the model provides a confidence for the overall count).
*   **Color Coding (Optional):** Use subtle color cues (e.g., green for high confidence, yellow for medium, red for low) for the text or a small indicator icon, but ensure this is accessible (e.g., not relying on color alone).
*   **Tooltips for Interpretation:** A tooltip could explain what the confidence score means in the context of that specific analysis (e.g., "This score reflects the model's certainty in the identified species based on the input image.").
*   **Threshold Indicators:** If predefined confidence thresholds are used (e.g., results below 70% are flagged), visually indicate this.
*   **In Reports:** Include confidence scores in downloadable reports alongside the primary results.
*   **Uncertainty Ranges:** For some models, instead of a single score, an uncertainty range or interval might be more appropriate. The UI should be able to adapt to display this if needed.

**API Consideration:**
The `AnalysisResult` objects returned by the API will include an optional `confidence_score` field (float, 0.0-1.0). The frontend should check for the presence of this field and display it if available.

This document provides a conceptual starting point. Detailed mockups and user testing would be essential for refining these features during actual implementation.
